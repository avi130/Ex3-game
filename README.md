The-Maze-Of-Waze-Navigation-Game

The main goal of the project is to:

1.Develop logic for a game in which a group of robots must perform movement tasks (fruit collection) on a weighted graph.

2.Create KML files that exemplify the game in google earth.

3.Collect as many fruits as possible and perform minimum robots moves during the limited time of the game.

There are two modes of game:
- Manual mode: you place your robots on the nodes that you want, 
and you decide which fruit you want to collect for each 
robot and so on untill the game is over.
- Auto mode:  play the best case that can be.

This assignment data structures and algorithms are based on previous project Ex2: https://github.com/avi130/OPP-Ex2
